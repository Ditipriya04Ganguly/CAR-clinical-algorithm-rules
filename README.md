# CLINICAL ALGORITHM RULES

We are working on an initiative where we are required to have a service which can work on some sort of rules. And it should be as configurable as possible.

# Function

We need to create an application which will flag a patient for higher scrutiny based on disease and other disorders. And since the rules of identification can change based on different studies thus the system must be flexible enough to incorporate the changes in the least disruptive manner.

**Rules Engine:** 
A rules engine is a flexible piece of software that manages business rules.
We have used **Drools**. 
Drools is a Business Rule Management System. It provides a rule engine which processes facts and produces output as a result of rules and facts processing. 
Rules will be written in english language format which is easy to understand. It separate rules with other compilation code, which gives flexibility to change the rule without deploying the component.

**Spring Boot:** This will be required to create a REST API.

**Postman:** This will be required for API testing.
